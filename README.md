## ABOUT ME...
My name is Karan Garg, fresher from EEE branch.(Roll No. 210108021)<br />
I play badminton, football and like to dance.<br />
I want to explore and learn from fields and domains, hoping to be somehow useful to the community in the future :)

## Why Open Source???
I find Open Source different from other domains of programming. We can contribute
to all kinds of projects. Thousands of people have a better user experience because
of a code that we wrote!! I find that pretty sweet. This is one of the reasons
why I want to learn more abou OS...
