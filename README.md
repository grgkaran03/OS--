## ABOUT ME...
My name is Karan Garg, fresher from EEE branch.(Roll No. 210108021)<br />
I play badminton, football and like to dance.<br />
I want to explore and learn from fields and domains, hoping to be somehow useful to the community in the future :)

## Why Open Source???
Open Source programming is different from other domains of programming, which
is something I really love about it. We can contribute to every kind of project
and people are directly affected by the code written by us!! This is pretty sweet 
and one of the reasons I want to lean more about it...
